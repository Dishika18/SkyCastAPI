# WeatherAPI

A Weather API, or Weather Application Programming Interface, is a service that provides programmatic access to weather-related information. It allows developers to integrate current weather conditions, forecasts, and other meteorological data into their applications, websites, or services. Weather APIs are valuable for a variety of applications, including mobile apps, websites, smart home devices, and more.

**Features:**

1) Current Weather Data:
   •Temperature: Current temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
   •Humidity: The percentage of moisture in the air.
